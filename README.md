# Analysis of Kalman Filter algorithm for improving position accuracy in boats

A Kalman Filter algorithm which I had implemeted based of a conference paper "**Method for improving positioning accuracy by
using double low-precision GPS**" by **Minghui Zhaoto**, **Jianhua Wang**, **Shanjia Zhang** and **Cheng Zhang (Year 2018)**.


## Brief Explanation of the Program 
The algorithm written in MATLAB takes input from Formatted_Data.csv. The data was generated by simulating the dynamics of a boat (the simulated data being the position output by two GPS sensors placed 2 meters apart). This data was taken as the original absolute path of the boat (True Measurement). Gaussian noise was then added to this dataset to simulate real world data (Sensor Data). The Noisy data is fed into the program and the results are compared with the originally generated data. 

## Results and Conclusions
The results proved a significant improvement in position accuracy. Graphs have been provided in the Results directory.

Further development can be done to improve the algorithm further so that data from many more sensors can be incorporated and be used in real time
